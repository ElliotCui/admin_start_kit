This is a scaffold for building an admin project.

UI is based on `bootstrap -v 4.6.0`.
Datetimepicker is based on `bootstrap4-datetime-picker-rails -v 0.3.1`, which works perfectly.

The next step will add more and more common tools, e.g. something about How to draw tables and lines for Dashboard.
